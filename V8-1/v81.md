## 7.1	File Structure
A JT file is structured as a sequence of blocks/segments. The File Header block is always the first block of data in the file. The File Header is followed (in no particular order) by a TOC Segment and a series of other Data Segments. The one Data Segment which must always exist to have a reference compliant JT file is the 7.2.1 LSG Segment.

The TOC Segment is located within the file using data stored in the File Header. Within the TOC Segment is information that locates all other Data Segments within the file. Although there are no JT format compliance rules about where the TOC Segment must be located within the file, in practice the TOC Segment is typically located either immediately following the File header (as shown in the below Figure) or at the very end of the file following all other Data Segments.

## 7.1.1	File Header
The File Header is always the first block of data in a JT file. The File Header contains information about the JT file version and TOC location, which Loaders use to determine how to read the file. The exact contents of the File Header are as follows:

Figure 2: File Header data collection

UChar : Version
An 80-character version string defining the version of the file format used to write this file. The Version string has the following format:
Version M.n Comment

Where M is replaced by the major version number, n is replaced by the minor version number, and Comment provides other unspecified information. The version string is padded with spaces to a length of 75 ASCII characters and then the final five characters must be filled with the following linefeed and carriage return character combination (shown using c-style syntax):

``` c++
Version[75] = ‘ ‘
Version[76] = ‘\n‘
Version[77] = ‘\r‘
Version[78] = ‘\n‘
Version[79] = ‘ ‘
```

These final 5 characters (shown above and referred to as ASCII/binary translation detection bytes) can be used by JT file readers to validate that the JT files has not been corrupted by ASCII mode FTP transfers.

So for a JT Version 8.1 file this string will look as follows:

``` c++
“Version 8.1 JT	\n\r\n “
```

UChar : Byte Order

Defines the file byte order and thus can be used by the loader to determine if there is a mismatch (thus byte swapping required) between the file byte order and the machine (on which the loader is being run) byte order. Valid values for Byte Order are:
0	– Least Significant byte first (LsbFirst)
1	– Most Significant byte first (MsbFirst)

I32 : File Attributes
All bits in this field are reserved

I32 : TOC Offset
Defines the byte offset from the top of the file to the start of the TOC Segment.

GUID : LSG Segment ID
LSG Segment ID specifies the globally unique identifier for the Logical Scene Graph Data Segment in the file. This ID along with the information in the TOC Segment can be used to locate the start of LSG Data Segment in the file. This ID is needed because without it a loader would have no way of knowing the location of the root LSG Data Segment. All other Data Segments must be accessible from the root LSG Data Segment.

## 7.1.2	TOC Segment
The TOC Segment contains information identifying and locating all individually addressable Data Segments within the file. A TOC Segment is always required to exist somewhere within a JT file. The actual location of the TOC Segment within the file is specified by the File Header segment’s “TOC Offset” field. The TOC Segment contains one TOC Entry for each individually addressable Data Segment in the file.

I32 : Entry Count
<br>Entry Count is the number of entries in the TOC.

## 7.1.2.1	TOC Entry
Each TOC Entry represents a Data Segment within the JT File. The essential function of a TOC Entry is to map a Segment ID to an absolute byte offset within the file.

GUID : Segment ID
Segment ID is the globally unique identifier for the segment.

I32 : Segment Offset
Segment Offset defines the byte offset from the top of the file to start of the segment.

I32 : Segment Length
Segment Length is the total size of the segment in bytes.

U32 : Segment Attributes
Segment Attributes is a collection of segment information encoded within a single U32 using the following bit allocation.

|             |                               |
| ----------- | ----------------------------- |
|Bits 0 - 23  |	Reserved for future use.      |
|Bits 24 - 31 |	Segment type. Complete list   |
|             | of Segment types can be found |
|             | in Table 3: SegmentTypes.     |
|             |                               |

## 7.1.3	Data Segment
All data stored in a JT file must be defined within a Data Segment. Data Segments are “typed” based on the general classification of data they contain. See Segment Type field description below for a complete list of the segment types.

Beyond specific data field compression/encoding, some Data Segment types also have a ZLIB compression conditionally applied to all the Data bytes of information persisted within the segment. Whether ZLIB compression is conditionally applied to a segment’s Data bytes of information is indicated by information stored with the first “Element” in the segment. Also Table 3: Segment Types has a column indicating whether the Segment Type may have ZLIB compression applied to its Data bytes.

All Data Segments have the same basic structure.

## 7.1.3.1	Segment Header
Segment Header contains information that determines how the remainder of the Segment is interpreted by the loader.

Figure 6: Segment Header data collection

![Alt text](image-5.png)

**GUID : Segment ID**
Global Unique Identifier for the segment.

**I32 : Segment Type**
Segment Type defines a broad classification of the segment contents. For example, a Segment Type of “1” denotes that the segment contains Logical Scene Graph material; “2” denotes contents of a B-Rep, etc.

The complete list of segment types is as follows:

Table 3: Segment Types
|      |                     |                                                                         |
| ---- | ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Type | Data Contents	    | ZLIB Compression Conditionally Applied to all of the  Segment’s Element Data |
| 1	| Logical Scene Graph |	Yes
| 2	| JT B-Rep | Yes
| 3	| PMI Data | Yes
| 4	| Meta Data | Yes
| 6	| Shape	| No
| 7	| Shape LOD0 | No
| 8	| Shape LOD1 | No
| 9	| Shape LOD2 | No
| 10 | Shape LOD3 | No
| 11 | Shape LOD4 | No
| 12 | Shape LOD5 | No
| 13 | Shape LOD6 | No
| 14 | Shape LOD7 | No
| 15 | Shape LOD8 | No
| 16 | Shape LOD9 | No
| 17 | XT B-Rep	| Yes
| 18 | Wireframe Representation	| Yes

**Note:** Segment Types 7-16 all identify the contents as LOD Shape data, where the increasing type number is intended to convey some notion of how high an LOD the specific shape segment represents. The lower the type in this 7-16 range the more detailed the Shape LOD (i.e.
Segment Type “7” is the most detailed Shape LOD Segment). For the rare case when there are more than 10 LODs, LOD9 and greater are all assigned Segment Type “16”.
<br>Note: The more generic Shape Segment type (i.e. Segment Type “6”) is used when the Shape Segment has one or more of the following characteristics:
1.	Not a descendant of an LOD node.
2.	Is referenced by (i.e. is a child of) more than one LOD node.
3.	Shape has its own built-in LODs
4.	No way to determine what LOD a Shape Segment represents.

**I32 : Segment Length**
<br>Segment Length is the total size of the segment in bytes. This length value includes all segment Data bytes plus the Segment Header bytes (i.e. it is the size of the complete segment) and should be equal to the length value stored with this segment’s TOC Entry.

## 7.1.3.2	Data
The interpretation of the Data section depends on the Segment Type. See 7.2 Data Segments for complete description for all Data Segment that may be contained in a JT file.
Although the Data section is Segment Type dependent there is a common structure which often occurs within the Data section. This structure is a list or multiple lists of Elements where each Element has the same basic structure which consists of some fixed length header information describing the type of object contained in the Element, followed by some variable length object type specific data.
Individual data fields of an Element data collection (and its children data collections) may have advanced compression/encoding applied to them as indicated through compression related data values stored as part

of the particular Element’s storage format. In addition, another level of compression (i.e. ZLIB compression) may be conditionally applied to all bytes of information stored for all Elements within a particular Segment. Not all Segment types support ZLIB compression on all Segment data as indicated in Table 3: Segment Types. If a particular file Segment is of the type which supports ZLIB compression on all the Segment data, whether this compression is applied or not is indicated by data values stored in the Element Header ZLIB data collection of the first Element within the Segment. An in-depth description of JT file compression/encoding techniques can be found in 8 Data Compression.

## 7.1.3.2.1	Element Header
Element Header contains data defining the length in bytes of the Element along with information describing the object type contained in the Element.

Figure 8: Element Header data collection

![Alt text](image-6.png)

**I32 : Element Length**
<br>Element Length is the total length in bytes of the element Object Data.

**GUID : Object Type ID**
<br>Object Type ID is the globally unique identifier for the object type. A complete list of the assigned GUID for all object types stored in a JT file can be found in Appendix A: Object Type Identifiers.

**UChar : Object Base Type**
<br>Object Base Type identifies the base object type. This is useful when an unknown element type is encountered and thus the best the loader can do is to read the known Object Base Type data bytes (base type object data is always written first) and then skip (read pass) the bytes of unknown data using knowledge of number of bytes encompassing the Object Base Type data and the unknown types Length field. If the Object Base Type is unknown then the loader should simply skip (read pass) Element Length number of bytes.

Valid Object Base Types include the following:
